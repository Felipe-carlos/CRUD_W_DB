# Building CRUD Applications Using Different Databases

This repository contains an application developed as part of my database studies. The goal is to implement a simple product management system using both SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis, CouchDB) databases.

Overview
The application serves as a simple product manager, allowing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) across various databases. The main menu provides an interface for interacting with these features.
